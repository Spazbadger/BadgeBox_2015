    <p>s there an activity you&rsquo;d really like to do more of? If you have the highest level of any of the badges, the Activity Plus badge could be your next big challenge.</p>
      <p>Your leader can award it if you have done really well in an activity. Your leader can also award you if you&rsquo;ve tried hard and done more than what was expected of you.</p>
      <p>You can also earn the Activity Plus if you&rsquo;ve taken something on even though you don&rsquo;t have the best facilities available.</p>
      <p><strong>To earn an Activity Plus badge you need to:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>hold your chosen activity badge</li>
        <li>agree a target with your leader before going for the Activity Plus badge. It might mean you have to take part in some more training or practice to help you learn more.</li>
        <li>show your leader that you have met your target.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Here are a few examples of targets for Beavers:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the Gardener Plus badge, look after your garden or allotment for a further three months. Depending on the time of year, either plant or harvest different types of plants. Explain how you know they&rsquo;re ready to plant or pick.</li>
        <li>For the Cook Plus badge, prepare and cook another three dishes and serve them as a meal.</li>
        <li>For the Animal Friend Plus badge, help to care for an animal for a further six weeks. Explain why you give it the type of food and exercise that you do.</li>

    <ul>
    <li>Know how to care for an animal.</li>

    <p><strong>Top tips</strong><br>
      The animal you care for could be a dog, cat, gerbil, guinea pig, fish, bird, rabbit, lamb or even a stick insect! Maybe you could help look after a family member&rsquo;s pet.</p>
    <p>Even though there are lots of computer games and things that show you what it&rsquo;s like to care for an animal, these won&rsquo;t count for this badge. You will need to learn to take care of a real, live animal.</p>

    Is there an activity you&rsquo;d really like to do more of? If you have the highest level of any of the badges, the Activity Plus badge could be your next big challenge.
    <p>Your leader can award it if you have done really well in an activity. Your leader can also award you if you&rsquo;ve tried hard and done more than what was expected of you.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>hold your chosen activity badge</li>
      <li>agree a target with your leader before going for the Activity Plus badge. It might mean you have to take part in some more training or practice to help you learn more.</li>
      <li>show your leader that you have met your target.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Here are a few examples of targets for Cubs:</strong><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For the Book Reader Plus, read at least another six books. Name the authors and tell your leader or other members of the Pack about them.</li>
      <li>For the Cyclist Plus, gain the Bikeability Level 3.</li>
      <li>For the DIY Plus, finish a DIY project that is more difficult than the example given.</li>

          <li>Using paper, prototype a game and explain to someone how it works. You could video your explanation.</li>
          <li>Evaluate and share your idea.</li>
